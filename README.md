# Customer-Classification-with-KNN-

**Project Overview**

Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict customer categories based on demographic and behavioral data from test_data.csv. 
Code covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to determine the optimal number of neighbors (K) for the KNN algorithm. 
The dataset includes features such as region, tenure, age, marital status, income, and more, with the target variable being custcat (customer category).


**Features**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Loads and normalizes features using StandardScaler.
- **Model Training:** Trains KNN models for K=1 to 10.
- **Evaluation:** Computes accuracy for each K and identifies the best K value.
- **Visualization:** Plots accuracy vs. K to visualize model performance.
- **Output:** Reports the highest accuracy achieved and the corresponding K value.
